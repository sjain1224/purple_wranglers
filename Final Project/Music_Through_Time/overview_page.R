     and roll through the history of American Music, from 1950's to
     now to exactly see how music has changed. Specifically, we will
     be looking at how the length of albums have changed, how the Top
     500 has been shaped through the years, and how genre popularity's
     have changed over time.")

    music. Their link sent me to a variety of different music datasets where I 
    found the one I selected. Its data was originally generated by [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts), 
    using their Top 200 Albums list. As said with Dataset One, Billboard is an 
    American entertainment company best known for its music charts, news, 
    videos, etc. about the most popular songs and albums in different genres; 
    further information can be found on its [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_magazine).")

    (unlike just singles in Dataset 1) every year since 
    January 1963, using Billboard's **Weekly Top 200 Albums**
    charts to create the dataset. It contains 573,948 
    observations (rows) and seven features (columns). Each 
    observation is information on one album. The seven 
    features are: Album ID, Date, Artist, Album, Rank, 
    Number of Tracks, and Track Length (in Milliseconds). 
    This data can be used to answer how music and artists 
    have changed over time and even how album length has 
    changed over time as well. It's important to note that 
    the popularity of an album can be affected by single 
    songs so it would also be interesting to see how the top
    albums match up with the top songs using dataset 1.")
